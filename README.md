# Textmatic

If you ever wanted a tool to simply push the SMS (or text messages) from your phone to somewhere remote, this is it.
This app matches all incoming and/or outgoing text messages against set rules and sends them over to webhook that you define.

If you find this app useful, send over your hugs :hugs: to [Float](https://float.africa/).
